# AntiCat
AntiCat is a MacOSX application that launches a transparent, full-screen window 
over the current screen and hides the menu bar etc.

##Why?

My friends Maud and Ezechiel were having problems one evening trying to watch something
as their new kitten kept jumping on the keyboard.

So, up against the clock and the cat I wrote this.  It probably took about half an hour (and may well look like it).

I'm putting it on GitHub incase anyone finds it useful or needs to know how to launch a full screen, transparent
window in OS X and intercept key-presses etc.

##Usage

The number of uses this app has are, quite literally, finite.  Off the top of my head I can think of:

* Stop cats pressing the spacebar whilst you're watching iPlayer
* An hilarious LOL practical joke
* Cleaning your keyboard
* And many (but not infinitely many) more.

Basically, just get your app/streaming music service or whatever working and your screen how you like it then
launch AntiCat.  

To quit use Cmd-Q (nb. This probably should be configurable, but we were in a hurry).

##License

CC0, however I don't know where the picture of the cat came from now.  If you want to do something with this
I'd suggest finding out/replacing the icons.
